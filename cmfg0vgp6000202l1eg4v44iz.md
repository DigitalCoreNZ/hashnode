# CompanyLite.com Requirements

The CompanyLite.com application is a collection of automation tools that help the owners/operators of SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) turn their static business plans into dynamic, living documents.

## Part 1: An Introduction

This document describes *how* to build the CompanyLite.com app, and *what* the app does for its' users.

Ultimately, the app will generate 6 types of documents:

* The Context Engineering Document, or CED (context-eng-for-(project).md),
    
* The Business Modelling Document, or BMD (business-model-for-(company).md),
    
* The Project Modelling Document, or PMD (project-model-for-(project).md),
    
* The Business Requirements Document, or BRD (business-req-for-(company).md),
    
* The Project Requirements Document, or PRD (project-req-for-(project).md), and
    
* The Business Plan Document, or BPD (business-plan-for-(company).md).
    

Each document serves a defined purpose:

* The CED helps developers create context documents for app development AI agents.
    
* The BMD helps users find customers *before* any products are designed and built.
    
* The PMD helps developers find users *before* any apps are designed and built.
    
* The BRD helps users describe *what* a specific application does *before* it is built.
    
* The PRD helps developers build *only* the features of a specific application, and
    
* The BPD helps users create an easily maintainable *living* business plan.
    

### The FREE Version

The BMD and BPD are available in the FREE version of CompanyLite.com. Features include:

* Unlimited editing of, and access to, the modelling and planning documents for a single company,

## Part 2: Building the App

### Development Technologies

The following technologies are used during the app development process.

#### The Expo Platform

Expo is an open-source platform designed to simplify the development of React Native applications, providing tools and services that help developers build, test, and quickly deploy apps for both iOS and Android. It includes features like the Expo Go app for instant testing, a collection of pre-built APIs, and a command-line interface for managing app development.

#### The React Native Framework

React Native is an open-source UI software framework developed by Meta Platforms. It is used to develop applications for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, Windows and UWP by enabling developers to use the React framework along with native platform capabilities. It is used to develop Android and iOS applications at Facebook, Microsoft, and Shopify. It is also being used to develop virtual reality applications at Oculus.

#### The Bun Runtime

Bun is a JavaScript runtime designed as a faster and more efficient alternative to Node.js, and is built using the Zig programming language. It includes features like a package manager, test runner, and bundler, aiming for high performance and compatibility with existing JavaScript applications.

#### The PostgreSQL RDBMS

PostgreSQL also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasising extensibility and SQL compliance. PostgreSQL features transactions with atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability properties, automatically updatable views, materialised views, triggers, foreign keys, and stored procedures. It is supported on all major operating systems, including Windows, Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD, and handles a range of workloads from single machines to data warehouses, data lakes, or web services with many concurrent users. The PostgreSQL Global Development Group focuses only on developing a database engine and closely related components. This core is, technically, what comprises PostgreSQL itself, but there is an extensive developer community and ecosystem that provides other important feature sets that might, traditionally, be provided by a proprietary software vendor.

#### The Microservices Architecture

In software engineering, the microservices architecture is a construction pattern that organises an application into a collection of loosely coupled, fine-grained services that communicate through lightweight protocols. This pattern is characterised by the ability to develop and deploy services independently, improving modularity, scalability, and adaptability. However, it introduces additional complexity, particularly in managing distributed systems and inter-service communication, making the initial implementation more challenging compared to a monolithic architecture. In some situations, like building multiple apps that share some features, the primary exertion of setting up the microservices is possibly worth the inherited technical debt.

#### The API Service

To create an API, you can use various programming languages and frameworks such as Node.js, FastAPI for Python, or Ruby on Rails. Additionally, tools like Postman and SwaggerHub can help with designing, testing, and documenting your API effectively.

### Developer Questions

The documents for context engineering, product modelling, business requirements, and product requirements ask similar, though different, sets of questions.

Business developer questions, primarily designed to elicit answers from software engineers, are focused on:

* UI and UX,
    
* Programming languages,
    
* Database requirements,
    
* Front-end tooling,
    
* etc.
    

Creating the context engineering document, in particular, presents many of its' questions as HTML select tags, radio buttons, and checkboxes. These answers can quickly guide a developer through the mundane aspects of an app (UI, target platforms, colour scheme, database choices, etc.) before diving into the unique features of the app.

I explored the integration of cutting-edge technologies like VS Code, Roo Code, and the BMAD Method to achieve greater efficiency and success.

Until next time: Be safe, be kind, be awesome.
