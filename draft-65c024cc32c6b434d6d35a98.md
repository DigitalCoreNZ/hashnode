# An Introduction.

DSPy (Demonstrate, Search, and Predict with Python) is used to programmatically provide "a more systematic approach to solving hard tasks with language Models."

> The purpose of this post is to provide a process for performing DSPy procedures.

# The Big Picture.

\[pending\]

# Prerequisites.

* A Debian-based Linux distro (I use Ubuntu),
    
* [Anaconda](https://solodev.app/installing-anaconda).
    

# Updating my Base System.

* From the (base) terminal, I update my (base) system:
    

```python
sudo apt clean && \
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y && \
sudo apt --fix-broken install && \
sudo apt autoclean && \
sudo apt autoremove -y
```

> NOTE: The Ollama LLM manager is already installed on my (base) system.

# What is Anaconda?

Python projects can run in virtual environments, which are isolated spaces for managing dependencies where different versions of the same packages can run while avoiding version conflicts; `venv` is a built-in Python 3.3+ module for running virtual environments, while Anaconda is a Python and R distribution for scientific computing that includes the `conda` package manager.

## Creating an Anaconda Environment.

* I use `conda` to display a `list` of Anaconda `env`ironments:
    

```bash
conda env list
```

* I use `conda` to `create`, and `activate`, a new environment named (-n) (DSPy):
    

```bash
conda create -n DSPy python=3.11 -y && conda activate DSPy
```

> NOTE: This command creates the (DSPy) environment, then activates the (DSPy) environment.

## Creating the `DSPy` Home Directory.

> NOTE: I will define the home directory with settings in the environment directory.

* I create the `DSPy` home directory:
    

```bash
mkdir ~/DSPy
```

* I make new directories within the (DSPy) environment:
    

```bash
mkdir -p ~/anaconda3/envs/DSPy/etc/conda/activate.d
```

* I use the Nano text editor to create the `set_working_directory.sh` shell script:
    

```bash
sudo nano ~/anaconda3/envs/DSPy/etc/conda/activate.d/set_working_directory.sh
```

* I add the following, save (CTRL + S) the changes, and exit (CTRL + X) Nano:
    

```bash
cd ~/DSPy
```

* I activate the (base) environment:
    

```bash
conda activate
```

* I activate the (DSPy) environment:
    

```bash
conda activate DSPy
```

> NOTE: I should now, by default, be in the `~/DSPy` home directory.
