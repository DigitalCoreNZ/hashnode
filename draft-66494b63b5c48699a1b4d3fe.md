# An Introduction.

# The Big Picture.

\[pending\]

# Prerequisites.

* A Debian-based Linux distro (I use Ubuntu).
    

# Updating my Base System.

* From the (base) terminal, I update my (base) system:
    

```python
sudo apt clean && \
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y && \
sudo apt --fix-broken install && \
sudo apt autoclean && \
sudo apt autoremove -y
```

> NOTE: The Ollama LLM manager is already installed on my (base) system.

# What is a Prompter?

## Asking Twinny for Advice.

* My first step was to prompt Twinny for advice:
    

```bash
Create an app-based teleprompter with voice-enabled scrolling
```

> NOTE: Below is the feedback.

### Determine the Purpose and Features of the App.

Before starting to code, it's important to determine what the app will do and what features it will have. In this case, I want to create an app-based teleprompter with voice-enabled scrolling.

### Plan the User Interface.

Once I know what the app will do, I can start planning the user interface. This includes designing the layout of the app, including any buttons or controls that users will interact with.

### Choose a Programming Language and Framework.

I'll need to choose a programming language and framework for the app. Some popular options for building mobile apps include Swift (for iOS) and Java (for Android).

### Setup a Development Environment.

Once I've chosen my programming language and framework, I'll need to set up my development environment. This includes installing any necessary software, such as Xcode or Android Studio, and reconfiguring my computer for development.

### Write the Code.

With my development environment set up, i can start writing the code for the app. This will involve creating the user interface, adding voice-enabled scrolling functionality, and connecting to a teleprompter device (if necessary).

### Test and Debug the App.

Once I've written the code, it's important to test and debug the app to ensure that it works as intended. I can use simulators or emulators to test the app on different devices before releasing it to the public.

### Release the App.

If the app is complete and tested, I can release it to the public! This involves submitting the app to app stores like the App Store (for iOS) and/or Google Play (for Android).
