# An Introduction.

# The Big Picture.

\[pending\]

# Prerequisites.

* A Debian-based Linux distro (I use Ubuntu).
    

# Updating my Base System.

* From the (base) terminal, I update my (base) system:
    

```python
sudo apt clean && \
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y && \
sudo apt --fix-broken install && \
sudo apt autoclean && \
sudo apt autoremove -y
```

> NOTE: The Ollama LLM manager is already installed on my (base) system.

# What is MasterLLMs.com?

MasterLLMs is a platform for learning how to *master LLMs*. LLMs is a computer industry acronym that stands for large language models. These models have popularised the use of AI in the public arena, as well as taken the computer science and engineering disciplines by storm.

Technically, AI development began in the late-1950s. Over the last 70-years, this field has had it's standout moments as well as lulls in progress. Luckily, the late 2000s saw deep learning rapidly improve. However, computer engineers *really* took an interest in 2017 when Microsoft scientists published a paper called "Attention is All You Need." Five years later, the general public became enamoured with AI when, in late-November 2022, OpenAI launched the world's first AI-based "killer app": ChatGPT.

The rest, as they say, is history.

For you, the rest is *your* history in the making.

## The Keys to the Kingdom.

MasterLLMs is your academy for learning how to master the following technologies:

* The Python programming language,
    
* The DSPy programming framework, and
    
* The LangChain application framework.
    

These technologies will help you become an effective AI developer. You will learn to leverage the power of LLMs for:

* Building the next generation of software solutions, and
    
* Use within the next generation of software solutions.
    

Are you ready to solve tomorrows' problems, today?

## Work Hard Today, Work Smart Tomorrow.

Learning a programming language and two different frameworks may sound difficult... because it is. As of May 2024, *modern* AI is only 14-months old, AL (After Leak, or since March 2023 when the LLaMA model from Meta was leaked to the public.) The relative youth of the LLM industry results in a moving target for AI developers. It is common to expect many cuts when working on the bleeding edge, and LLMs are very sharp, indeed.

> NOTE: LLaMA stands for Large Language Model Meta AI.

Mastering these three, specific technologies (Python, DSPy, and LangChain) will open a whole new world of opportunity in your near future.

## Learning Python: An Outline.

Here are the topics you will cover while learning Python.

### Starting with the Basics.

Before diving into more advanced topics, it's important to understand the basics of Python programming. This includes understanding variables, data types, loops (e.g., for and while loops), conditional statements (if/else), functions, and modules.

### Learning Basic Data Structures.

Once you have a solid foundation in the basics, it's time to learn about data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and arrays.

### Moving on to Advanced Data Structures.

After learning basic data structures, you can move on to more advanced structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

### Learning about Algorithms and Data Analysis.

Once you have a good understanding of data structures, it's time to learn about algorithms and data analysis. This includes topics like sorting, searching, and graph traversal.

### Learning about Object-Oriented Programming.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept in Python that allows you to create reusable code and build complex applications.

### Learning about Web Development.

With Python, you can build web applications using popular frameworks like Django and Flask.

### Learning about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

Python has a rich ecosystem for machine learning and AI, with libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and TensorFlow.

### Learn about Data Visualization.

With Python, you can create beautiful and informative data visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### Practising and Building Projects.

The best way to learn Python is by practising and building projects. Start with small projects and gradually work your way up to more complex ones.

### Joining a Community.

There are many online communities and forums dedicated to Python programming, where you can ask questions, share knowledge, and learn from others.

Learning Python (in fact, *any* programming language) takes time and practice, so be patient and keep practising!

## Learning DSPy: An Outline.

Here are the topics you will cover while learning DSPy.

> NOTE: The backronym for DSPy is now Declarative Self-improving Language Programs, pythonically.

## Learning LangChain: An Outline.
