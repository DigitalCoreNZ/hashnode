# What is a Plan?

For me, plans are those things that make pitiful "no, no, wait!!" noises as I toss them out the window. (Deadlines, on the other hand, make wooshing sounds as they fly past.)

It's great having a plan. It's even better following through on said plan. Sadly, things have not *gone* to plan. This is what happened.

# The Great Distraction.

The plan involved using LLMs to build apps and websites. After 6 months of LLM research (Ollama, LangChain, DSPy, AutoGen, LiteLLM, etc.), I accidentally came across a Copilot-like utility for VS Code. This free Extension, called Twinny, used local LLMs to power its abilities. That's when I made a horrifying discovery: LLMs themselves are *not* great at generating code. LangChain and DSPy could fix some surface issues but not the underlying problems. So, I dove into a rabbit hole.

# Mastering Python.

I needed to use Python to solve the deeper issues of using LLMs for programming, but to fix the problem, I needed to master the Python ecosystem. For me, the best way to learn a subject is to teach that subject. However, I didn't have anyone to teach. So, I started writing a book, instead. Down another rabbit hole I went, like a dream within a dream, where even the Cheshire Cat considers the whole situation ridiculous. "Oh, it's you. Again. Meow."

# Solving the Deepest of AI Problems.

I was working on my first chapter when a paper dropped that excited the whole AI community. The paper is called [KAN: Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756). The Kolmogorov–Arnold Representation Theorem looks suspiciously like the Universal Approximation Theorem that powers Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) deep-learning models.

It was like my brain was suddenly struck by lightening. The more I read, the more I knew *exactly* how to solve the problem with modern AI.

Sadly, I have a problem of my own.

# Solving the Deepest of Personal Problems.

I have undiagnosed ADHD. Usually, I don't worry about it. I know I'll *never* finish my book about Python. I know I'll *never* master Ollama, LangChain, DSPy, or AutoGen. I know I'll *never* launch 24 startups in 12 months. I'll definitely expend a lot of energy *trying* to achieve these goals, but there's a deep-down certainty that I'll find another rabbit hole, and when found, I'll explore it with relish and move even further from my original goal (24 Startups, etc., etc.). I've happily drifted through the last 10-ish years without a care. I know how to "work the system" and would have continued on my blissful way without knowing where things would end.

Then I read that blasted paper.

And my stupid brain woke up.

I kept telling myself "There's lots of smart people who'll figure it out. Drop it."

My brain, on the other hand, was having opinions: "They'll get it wrong!! Besides, all the smart people are busily following the wrong leads."

"C'mon," I plead. "Let's just stay out of it. It's not our problem!!"

My brain sneered "It *became* our problem the moment you worked out the solution!!"

"No," I childishly retorted. "I didn't work out anything. I just had an idea."

"Yes," my brain confirmed. "You had an idea, and now *I'm* working out the details."

I mumble to my brain "It won't work, you know," as I grumpily look down at my feet. "I have a solid record of *not* finishing anything I start."

My brain paused for a moment. "Yes-s... I've been think about that." My brain-voice took on a careful tone. "How do you feel about... talking with... someone..." My brain-voice trailed off.

My eyes narrowed in suspicion as I echoed "Talk with someone?"

"Sure," said my brain. "You know? Someone who's good at... listening."

Suddenly, my eyes widened. "A psychiatrist! You want to go see a psychiatrist!!"

My brain pulled itself up by it's anthropomorphic britches. "Now listen here..."

"I'm not crazy!"

"No-one said you were..."

"I'm in full control of my faculties!!" I wave an accusatory finger in the general direction of my grey matter. "It's you! It's *your* fault!! It's you that's broken!!!"

# The Blame Game.

My brain was stunned, hypnotised by my wildly stabbing finger, not knowing what to say.

Oh, no. What I just said was definitely... Very. Bad.

"I mean," I stammered shamefully, "No, that's not what I mean. No, of course you're not... You are not. Broken." My eyes darted around the room, desperately looking for something else to say.
