# The Idea - My Business Concept.

Digital Core (NZ) Limited is a technology startup based in Auckland, New Zealand. We are focused on changing the way software is created and deployed. Our main vision is to create an environment where digital ideas have a practical path to market. By building this pipeline, the company aims to facilitate a continuous process of growth, and refinement, that is deeply rooted in consumer feedback mechanisms.

DigitalCore is committed to fostering a culture of open communication with testers and early adopters, ensuring their unique perspectives are highly valued and deeply considered. We will embrace this approach as the features of our applications evolve. The company will strive to create a synergistic ecosystem where consumer ideas have a sympathetic effect on the evolution of an application.

DigitalCore places a strong emphasis on leveraging data-driven insights. We plan to optimize our production pipeline specifically to examine these observations while also reducing an application's time to market. The company will identify trends, patterns, and opportunities that help inform our strategic decision-making while also driving home the tactical implementations of continuous improvement.

DigitalCore envisions a future where its' technology solutions exceed consumer expectations, resulting in thriving, sustainable apps that are at the forefront of technological innovation and consumer satisfaction.

DigitalCore will create, refine, and deploy cutting-edge business utilities, and lifestyle utilities, that significantly elevate the quality of business operations and modern living. By leveraging innovative approaches to usage analysis and data collection, we strive to develop solutions that cater to the current mobile needs of our users while also anticipating their future expectations. In doing so, we will establish an enduring company that consistently helps our customers to improved business and lifestyle activities that enhances their ability to organically engage with our modern world.

## Running our Ideation Viability Processes (IVPs).

To assess the feasibility of our ideas, we will employ a simple Ideation Viability Process (IVP). The IVP involves:

* Market assessments,
    
* Identifying potential revenue streams,
    
* Production and hosting cost analysis, and
    
* Building Minimum Viable Products (MVPs).

By meticulously evaluating the potential of each idea, we can ensure that our solutions remain relevant, competitive, and capable of delivering exceptional value to our users, ultimately contributing to a higher standard of living in today's fast-paced world.

## Building our Minimum Viable Products (MVPs).

\[pending\]

Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) are alpha-stage apps that *usually* include the first feature from the Rollout Calendar. MVPs, include feedback mechanisms for testers and early adopters. Their feedback informs our strategic decisions, i.e. Is the time spent on iterative improvements, and developing the next feature from the rollout calendar a viable option for the product in question?

## Our "Special Sauce".

Every company needs a strategic advantage to successfully compete with other app developers. Our special "sauce" involves "cooking" a complicated "recipe" using LLMs (large language models) as "special ingredients".

We current use an off-the-shelf extension for VS Code called Twinny ([https://github.com/rjmacarthy/twinny](https://github.com/rjmacarthy/twinny)).

# Financial & Marketing Overview.

## Current Financial Viability in the Market.

The tactical financial viability of DigitalCore requires an assessment of our products' financial performance, market position, and growth potential. We also need to identify any opportunities for improvements and optimisations. We will evaluate specific factors, such as market demand, profitability, competitive landscape, and potential risks. By doing so, We can identify our short-term financial sustainability, which we will use as our immediate step to long-term financial success.

## Future Financial Viability in the Market.

Our strategic financial sustainability requires a thorough evaluation because it is crucial to examine potential factors that could impact our ability to operate and generate consistent revenue in the future.

By conducting this analysis, we can obtain a clear understanding of our financial health and the capacity to withstand economic fluctuations. This information will enable us to define our potential for long-term financial success. By identifying our strengths and weaknesses, we can devise strategies to capitalise on opportunities for improvement while ensuring our growth and prosperity.

Crisis management is a small, but essential, part of our strategic plan. Automation, on the other hand, plays a much bigger part of our financial strategy. The somewhat verbose topic of automation is covered, in detail, later in this document.

## Critical Factors for Financial Success.

To achieve financial success in the mobile app market, we must remain aware of the ever-changing needs of our users. By continuously adapting our products, and evolving their features, we can help our apps remain relevant, engaging, and competitive. This proactive approach to development and design ultimately contributes to the long-term financial success of the company while improving our chances of becoming a thought leader in the app development community.

These are the key factors that determine the financial success of an app:

1\. Understanding our target audience: Gaining a deep understanding of an app's target audience, their preferences, and their pain points, is essential to creating a solution that caters to our users specific needs. This also helps with identifying gaps in the market, developing a loyal user base, and driving consistent revenue.

2\. Innovation and differentiation: In a saturated market, it is crucial to stand out from the competition by offering unique and innovative answers. This can be achieved by constantly researching and implementing new solutions, developing unique features, and designing performant elements, that sets our apps apart from their competitors.

3\. User experience and engagement: Ensuring a seamless and enjoyable user experience is vital to retaining users while encouraging them to recommend our apps to other consumers. This can be accomplished by focusing on intuitive design, smooth functionality, and usability features, that keep our users engaged.

4\. Effective marketing and promotion: A well-executed marketing strategy is essential to creating an awareness of our apps. We can utilize various marketing channels such as social media, influencer partnerships, and targeted advertising, to help with reaching the right audience and boosting the visibility of our apps.

5\. Monetization strategy: Developing a robust and sustainable monetization strategy is key to generating consistent revenue. This can include in-app purchases, subscription models, and advertising, depending on the nature of the app and its target audience.

By focusing on these critical factors, we can help our apps remain relevant and competitive. This will contribute to the long-term financial success of the company and build our position as a leader in the app market.

## The Market.

The market for mobile applications presents a plethora of opportunities for the business. The reliance on smartphones and tablets, especially for day-to-day activities, fuels the demand for innovative, user-friendly, and efficient mobile apps. This demand has created a fertile ground for businesses to create unique solutions that cater to the diverse needs of a global consumer market.

The mobile app market is segmented into numerous categories, including gaming, productivity, entertainment, social networking, health and fitness, and more. Each of these categories offers distinct possibilities for businesses to target specific user groups and demographics, allowing us to tailor our offerings accordingly. Furthermore, the market is characterized by the presence of both established players and emerging startups, which fosters a dynamic environment that encourages innovation and the development of cutting-edge technologies.

As the mobile app market continues to grow, companies like DigitalCore need to stay ahead of the curve by identifying and capitalizing on emerging trends and opportunities. By leveraging our passion for app development while staying attuned to the ever-changing needs of consumers, we can adapt our products so they remain relevant, and competitive, in this fast-paced sector. This will ultimately contribute to the long-term financial success of the company and solidify our potential leadership in the app market.

# What We Offer â€“ Our Initial Products.

Given the competitive nature of the app market, we have outlined a strategic plan for 2024 where the technical focus is on development, deployment, and continuous improvement of three key products: GroceryCart.org, RecipeAlbum.org, and CueVox.com (formally VocalCue.com). The strategic plan for 2024 also includes sales and marketing actions for each product.

## GroceryCart.org: An Introduction.

GroceryCart.org is a comprehensive shopping and receipt management application designed to revolutionize the way users approach their grocery shopping experience.

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of our app includes two initial features:

* A cutting-edge, camera-enabled Receipt Scanner with an OCR (optical character recognition) module, and
    
* A geo-fenced, GPS-enabled Item Finder with on-screen directions.
    

The Receipt Scanner allows users to easily photograph their grocery receipts, convert these receipts to data files, and then use this data with our built-in analyser to provide insights beyond what a typical expense tracker provides. Users can also *anonymously* share their findings with others who use our app and, collectively, build a real-time region-based cost-of-living breakdown. Our users' living costs can then be compared to other districts, and to the nation as a whole, which shows how Crowd Wisdom can be used to create a collective benefit.

Our server examines the uploaded data files to identify local retailers offering the most competitive prices for specific items. This is another Crowd Wisdom feature that empowers GroceryCart.org users to make informed decisions about their shopping habits, ultimately based on users helping each other to save money and discover the best deals in their area.

As the app evolves, additional features and enhancements will be introduced to further streamline our users' shopping experience while catering to their diverse needs. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) version of this app includes an isle navigator (for finding grocery items in a store) and an OCR - optical character recognition - receipt scanner (for budgeting management).
