## Setting Up the Roo Code Extension to Use the BMAD Method.

* I open VS Code and navigate to the project folder (File &gt; Open Folder…):
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754880578532/462d8c67-144a-4597-a5c0-9f211978530b.png align="center")

> NOTE: The Explorer tab shows two hidden directories and a hidden YAML file called `.roomodes`. The `.roomodes` file loads 11 custom modes into Roo Code and makes them available for use alongside the built-in modes.

* I open the `.bmad-core` folder, right-click the `user-guide.md` file, and select Open Preview from the pop-up menu:
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754881288103/97429960-cecf-48d0-8b24-f1264fb09ceb.png align="center")

* If the flowchart images are not displayed, I install the `Markdown All in One` extension from Yu Zhang, and the `Markdown Preview Mermaid Support` extension from Matt Bierner.
    
* I open the Roo Code extension.
    
* At the bottom-left of Roo Code, there are two similar buttons with up-arrows. I click the one on the left called the `Select mode for interaction`.
    
* I click the gear icon to enter the `Mode Settings` menu:
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754885694825/c08c0d47-d38d-46ef-9b0a-5901e9021985.png align="center")

* I take note of the 11 new modes that are available in this project:
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754885558800/a7643c5b-f87f-494a-97be-4517f7010eeb.png align="center")

## Optional - Cleaning Up the BMAD Modes.

* In the `.roomodes` file, I rearrange the modes so they match, from top to bottom, the flow charts in the `user-guide.md` file.
    
* I prepend the `name:` settings with BMAD, e.g. ‘Business Analyst’ becomes ‘BMAD Business Analyst‘.
    
* Sometimes, I will shorten a `name:`, e.g. ‘Full Stack Developer‘ to ’BMAD Developer’, and ‘Senior Developer & QA Architect‘ to ‘BMAD Senior Dev & QA‘.
    

> NOTE: I leave the last 3 modes at the bottom of the file because I don’t use them.

## Creating Roo Code Slash Commands.

* At the bottom-right of Roo Code, I click the `Manage slash commands` icon (that looks like a lightning bolt):
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754904243523/83310ddb-b2f5-4952-a27f-29b79af56886.png align="center")

* In the `New global command…` field, I add a new slash command called `/analyse`:
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754904947340/b31274f4-d311-45b9-a14a-eb5f76dd855a.png align="center")

* I click the plus (+) button next to my new slash (/) command:
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754905898663/baeaabf0-169b-45e3-96b9-7de12559d3cd.png align="center")

> NOTE: I choose to create custom, global, slash commands because I will then be able to reuse those commands in other projects.

* I click the `Edit command` button next to the new slash command to open the `.roo/commands/analyse.md` file.
    
* In the `description:`, I write “BMAD Analyst“
    
* I replace the other, white text with `./.bmad-core/agents/analyst.md` command.
    

> NOTE: In the Roo Code prompt dialog box, I can type a slash (/) and the custom `/analyse` command is displayed, and available, which is set call on the `analyst.md` file. If I am in any other mode, the `/analyse` command will call the Business Analyst directly:

> HINT: Thanks to the BMAD Method doing most of “the heavy lifting“, I can use cheaper AI models like OpenAI: gpt-oss-120b, Qwen: Qwen3 235B A22B Thinking 2507, and Google: Gemini Flash 2.0 (I use OpenRouter.ai to gain access to most of the AI models from nearly all of the AI companies).

By following the detailed steps outlined, I can effectively implement the BMAD Method, customize Roo Code with new modes, and create reusable slash commands to streamline my workflow. This approach not only automates repetitive tasks but also fosters improved collaboration and efficiency throughout the software development life cycle. As I continue to explore and utilize these tools, I must remember to adapt and customize these utilities to best fit the unique needs of each project.

---
