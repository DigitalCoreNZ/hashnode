## The Big Picture.

BMAD for Roo Code is essential for my understanding of how to effectively integrate AI with Agile methodologies. This guide walks through the installation and setup process, providing insights into how the BMAD Method enhances my software development by enhancing many, tedious tasks. By following the steps outlined in this post, the result is a streamlined workflow for leveraging innovations that boosts my effectiveness when creating my projects.

> NOTE: The following process results in a single installation that is used across multiple projects.

---

## Prerequisites.

* A Debian-based Linux distro (I use Ubuntu),
    
* The Roo Code Extension,
    
* VS Code, and
    
* Node v20+.
    

---

## Updating my Base System.

* From the (base) terminal, I update my (base) system:
    

```python
sudo apt clean && \
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y && \
sudo apt --fix-broken install && \
sudo apt autoclean && \
sudo apt autoremove -y
```

> NOTE: The Ollama LLM manager is already installed on my (base) system.

## Installing the BMAD Method.

From the terminal, I install the BMAD Method:

```bash
npx bmad-method install
```

> NOTE: As I am already in the installation directory, I type a period (.) to install BMAD into the current location.

* On the next screen, I use the up/down arrow keys to move the selector, use the SPACEBAR to select/deselect multiple options, and hit the ENTER key:

> NOTE: Sharding is used to intelligently break large documents into a collection of smaller documents. The purpose of sharding is to provide LLMs with prompts that do not overwhelm the context window.

* On the next screen, I use the up/down arrow keys to move the selector and the SPACEBAR to make my selections, and then I tap the ENTER key:

## Editing the .roomodes & .kilocodemodes Files.

The trick to using a single instance or BMAD across multiple projects is to:

* Open the files in a text editor,
    
* Changing every instance of a relative to an absolute path and saving the results, and
    
* Adding copies of these files into the root directories of every project.
    

In this post, for example, the installation directory is `/home/brian/.roo/commands`, so in the .roocodes and .kilocodemodes files I would change a relative path, like `.bmad-core/agents/`[`ux-expert.md`](http://ux-expert.md), so that it becomes an absolute path, like `/home/brian/.roo/commands/.bmad-core/agents/ux-expert.md`.

## BMAD v6.

I also install BMAD v6 into the same location. Here is the installation command for BMAD v6 (currently in Public Alpha):

```bash
npx bmad-method@alpha install
```

---

## The Results.

The installation and setup of the BMAD Method for Roo Code provides a robust framework for integrating AI with Agile methodologies, enhancing the software development process. By following the detailed steps outlined, I can effectively implement the BMAD Method, customise Roo Code with new modes, and create reusable slash commands to streamline my workflow. This approach not only automates repetitive tasks but also fosters improved collaboration and efficiency throughout the software development life cycle. As I continue to explore and utilise these tools, I must remember to adapt and customise these utilities to best fit the unique needs of each project.

---

## In Conclusion.

I learned how to seamlessly integrate AI with Agile methodologies using the BMAD Method for Roo Code. This comprehensive guide covered the installation, setup, and customisations that enhances my software development processes and automates many of the tasks I perform. The BMAD method is perfect for developers looking to streamline their workflow with innovative tools.

Until next time: Be safe, be kind, be awesome.
