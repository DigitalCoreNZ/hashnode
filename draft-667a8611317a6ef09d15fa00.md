# Overview.

The AN231E04 device is an “Analog Signal Processor” that is used for:

* Signal Conditioning,
    
* Filtering,
    
* Gain,
    
* Summing,
    
* Multiplying,
    
* Subtracting,
    
* Rectification,
    
* Sensor Response Linearization,
    
* Arbitrary Waveform Synthesis, and
    
* Other Functions.

The AN231E04 device consists of a 2x2 matrix of fully Configurable Analog Blocks (CABs), surrounded by programmable interconnect resources and analog input/output cells with active elements. On chip clock generator block controls multiple non-overlapping clock domains generated from an external stable clock source. Internal band-gap reference generator is used to create temperature compensated reference voltage levels. The inclusion of an 8x256 bit look-up table enables waveform synthesis and several non-linear functions.
