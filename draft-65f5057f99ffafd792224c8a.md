# What is VocalCue?

SpeechTest is a Python module, that is built by Pythagora, that tests the DeepSpeech engine.

## The Website Prompt.

Project Name: VocalCue.

### The website details.

You are a TypeScript programmer.

The frontend webpages are built with HTMX ([https://htmx.org](https://htmx.org/reference/)) and PicoCSS ([https://picocss.com](https://picocss.com/)).

The middleware servers are built with Node ([https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en)), Express ([https://expressjs.com/](https://expressjs.com/)), and Passport ([https://www.passportjs.org/docs/](https://www.passportjs.org/docs/)).

Authentication is managed by the Passport API and confirmed with JSON Web Tokens.

The backend database is PostgreSQL.

You will create a website that is made up of nine pages:

* The public Homepage called index.html,
    
* The public Register Page called register.html,
    
* The public Sent Page called sent.html.
    
* The public Recovery Page called recovery.html,
    
* The user Confirmed page called confirmed.html,
    
* The user Main Page called main.html,
    
* The user Editor Page called editor.html,
    
* The user Display Page called display.html, and
    
* The user Delete Page called delete.html.
    

Public pages are available for viewing by anyone. User Pages can only be viewed by their respective registered users.

The top of every page is where the title image for each page is displayed. The title images are stored in the `/images` directory.

The website follows responsive design principles so that the site can be viewed on mobile phones.

### The index.html page details.

The top of the page is where the index.png title image is displayed. This image is scaled down to fit on mobile phones.

Below the title image, at the top-right of the screen, is a form (where `action=/login` and `method=POST`) that contains:

* An email text box where `id=login-email`,
    
* A password text box where `id=login-password`, and
    
* The Submit button where `id=login-submit`.
    

To the right of the form is a register link.

When a registered user adds their email address, their password, and clicks the Submit button, their details are sent to our server for evaluation. If the supplied details match the details in the Users database, then:

* A session cookie is sent to their browser, and
    
* The user is sent to the main.html page.
    

If the supplied details are NOT correct, then the user is sent to the recovery.html page.

The register link takes the user to the register.html page.

### The register.html page details.

The top of the page is where the register.png title image is displayed. This image is scaled down to fit on mobile phone displays.

On the register.html page is a form (where `action=/register` and `method=POST`) that contains:

* An email text box where `id=register-email`, and
    
* The Submit button where `id=register-submit`.
    

When a user adds their email address and clicks the Submit button, the email address is sent to our server for evaluation.

If the email address is not in our database, then an email with a magic link is sent to the email address and the user is sent to the sent.html page. If the email address is in our database, then the user is sent to the recovery.html page.

### The sent.html page details.

The top of the page is where the sent.png title image is displayed. This image is scaled down to fit on mobile phone displays.

The public Sent Page tells the user that they should check for our email that includes the magic link.

### The recovery.html page details.

The top of the page is where the recovery.png title image is displayed. This image is scaled down to fit on mobile phone displays.

The recovery.html page contains two forms.

The first form (where `action=/recovery` and `method=POST`) includes:

* An Email Text Box with `id=recovery-email`, and
    
* A Submit button with `id=recovery-submit`.
    

When a user adds their email address and clicks the Submit button, the the email address is sent to our server for evaluation.

If the email address is in our database, then an email with a magic link is sent to the email address and the user is sent to the sent.html page. If the email address is NOT in our database, a dialog box pops up saying there was a problem, and then the user is sent to the register.html page.

Under the Register heading is the second form.

The second form (where `action=/register` and `method=POST`) contains:

* An email text box where `id=register-email`, and
    
* The Submit button where `id=register-submit`.
    

When a user adds their email address and clicks the Submit button, the email address is sent to our server for evaluation.

If the email address is not in our database, then an email with a magic link is sent to the email address and the user is sent to the sent.html page. If the email address is in our database, a dialog box pops up saying there was a problem, and then the user is returned to the recovery.html page.
