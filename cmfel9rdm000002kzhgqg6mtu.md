## TL;DR.

Using system images allows for efficient computer management by separating system files from personal data, ensuring easy recovery and enhancing productivity. Regularly updating and creating production images facilitates quick restoration and experimentation with new technologies, saving time and providing peace of mind.

## An Introduction.

Using system images allows for efficient computer management by separating system files from personal data:

> The purpose of this post is to justify the creation, and use, of operating system images.

## The Big Picture.

Creating, and using, operating system images offers a range of features and benefits that enhance computer management and productivity:

1. **Efficient System Management**: System images allows me to capture the entire state of an operating system, including installed applications, system settings, and configurations. This makes it easy to manage and maintain systems, especially in environments with multiple computers.
    
2. **Quick Recovery and Restoration**: In the event of system failure, corruption, or malware attack, a system image can be used to quickly restore my system to a previous, stable state. This minimises downtime and ensures business continuity.
    
3. **Separation of System and Data**: By keeping system files separate from personal data, I can ensure that my important information is safe and easily recoverable. This separation also simplifies the process of updating or upgrading the operating system without affecting my personal files.
    
4. **Experimentation and Testing**: System images provide a safe environment for testing new software, updates, or configurations. I can experiment with new technologies without the risk of permanently altering my primary system setup.
    
5. **Time-Saving**: Regularly updating and creating system images reduces the time required for system setup and configuration. When a system needs to be reinstalled, the image can be deployed quickly, saving time compared to manual installation and configuration.
    
6. **Consistency Across Systems**: In organisational settings, system images ensure consistency across multiple computers. This is particularly useful for IT departments that need to deploy standardised environments across a network of machines.
    
7. **Peace of Mind**: Knowing that a reliable backup of the system exists provides peace of mind. I can be confident that I can recover my system to a working state with minimal effort.
    
8. **Cost-Effective**: By reducing the need for technical support and minimising downtime, system images can lead to cost savings for both individuals and organisations.
    

Overall, the use of operating system images is a practical approach to managing my computer systems, enhancing my productivity, and ensuring my data is security separated from my operating system.

## Prerequisites.

* A Debian-based Linux distro (I use Ubuntu).
    

---

## Updating my Base System.

* From the (base) terminal, I update my (base) system:
    

```python
sudo apt clean && \
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y && \
sudo apt --fix-broken install && \
sudo apt autoclean && \
sudo apt autoremove -y
```

> NOTE: The Ollama LLM manager is already installed on my (base) system.

## What is CloneZilla Live?

[Clonezilla Live](https://clonezilla.org/liveusb.php) is a small, bootable GNU/Linux distribution that can be used to image, or “clone”, individual computers using an (obsolete) CD/DVD or USB flash drive.

## Why I Can Re-Image My System.

I have always separated my system from my data. Over the years, I have saved my data to:

* 5¼” floppy diskettes,
    
* 3½” floppy diskettes,
    
* External serial Zip Drives,
    
* External USB SATA HDDs,
    
* External USB Enclosures with SATA SSDs, and
    
* External USB Enclosures with M.2 NVMe Drives.
    

> NOTE: I was very happy to get my purplish-blue 750MB Zip drive from Iomega. And then I found out they also had the 1TB Jaz drive. *Oh, well.* I used the Zip drive for years, even when I started using external USB drives. It finally died in the early 2010s.

At the moment, I use a 4-bay NAS with RAID-5 redundancy that has an external 5TB USB HDD that is used for backups.

Saving my data to the NAS means I can restore a previously saved system image to my PC. For decades, I have very rarely worried about loosing anything important.

Last year, I had an HDD fail on me (and I still have a sour taste about the incident). I checked the drive and, luckily for me, the data could be retrieved. So I set that drive aside (fully intending to recover the data), used another HDD, and started saving up for a 4-bay NAS and 4 × 6TB HDDs. Now that I have a NAS, I’m starting to think about getting another one for replication. It couldn’t hurt.

Also, I never recovered the data from the failed HDD. I keep prioritising work over recovery. The busted drive has been sitting on my PC for over a year, quietly gathering dust, and now I can barely remember what it contained.

> NOTE: I have now added the failed drive to a pile of other HDDs that are scheduled for physical destruction… some day.

## Updating My Fresh System Image.

Every few months, I will:

* Install my fresh system image,
    
* Apply all of the updates, and
    
* Replace the old system image.
    

This update simply reduces the system update time whenever I use the system image.

---

## Fresh Image vs. Production Image.

Often, I will load my fresh system image, add a few apps or utilities, and save it as a production image.

The purpose of production images is to have specific apps and utilities ready to use as soon as I restore a production image. I will even create a production image that contains *everything.*

Sometimes, I will create an image of my current setup, switch to a different image, do what I needed to achieve, and then restore my current setup.

The reason for having multiple images is education. Technology moves fast, especially AI technology, so using an image where I can run experiments allows me to explore how new tech can be integrated into my existing workflow.

## Replacing My PC.

My PC died in 2019. I had to save up for a replacement and I got a new PC with an AMD Ryzen 5 2600 CPU. It has 6 cores and supports 12 threads. Over the years, I have:

* Upgraded the RAM to its maximum of 64GB,
    
* Installed a 1TB M.2 NVMe drive for Ubuntu,
    
* Installed a 512GB SATA SSD for Windows,
    
* Installed a 256GB SATA SSD for storage, and
    
* Installed a 12GB VRAM Nvidia RTX-3060 graphics card.
    

Switching to a different PC made no difference to my data. Everything important was saved to an external HDD (until it died 5-years later).

Even with my old - and long expired - PC, I was using system images. I even used a similar product to CloneZilla Live when I was still using Windows as my daily driver and primary system (before switching to Linux distros in 2015). Creating, and using, system images just feels like the right process for me.

## The Results.

Using system images is a practical and efficient way to manage and maintain my computer systems. By separating system files from personal data, I can ensure that my important information is always safe and easily recoverable. Regularly creating production images allows for quick restoration and experimentation with new technologies. This approach not only saves time but also provides peace of mind, knowing that my system can be restored to a working state with minimal effort. Embracing system images as part of my workflow significantly enhances my productivity and adaptability in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
