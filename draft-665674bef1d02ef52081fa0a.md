# An Introduction.

\[pending\]

# The Big Picture.

\[pending\]

# Prerequisites.

* A Debian-based Linux distro (I use Ubuntu).
    

# Updating my Base System.

* From the (base) terminal, I update my (base) system:
    

```python
sudo apt clean && \
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y && \
sudo apt --fix-broken install && \
sudo apt autoclean && \
sudo apt autoremove -y
```

> NOTE: The Ollama LLM manager is already installed on my (base) system.

# What is pipx?

pipx is a tool that helps me install and run Python applications in isolated environments. It's similar to macOS's brew, JavaScript's npx, and Linux's apt. It works with pip, but it focuses on installing and managing Python packages that I can run from the command line as applications.

pip is a general-purpose package installer for both libraries and apps that have no environment isolation. pipx is made specifically for application installation, as it adds isolation yet still makes the apps available in my shell: pipx creates an isolated environment for each application and its associated packages. pipx does not ship with pip, but installing it is often an important part of bootstrapping my system.

## Installing pipx.

* I update my (base) system:
    

```bash
sudo apt update
```

* I install pipx:
    

```bash
sudo apt install -y pipx
```

* I ensure that the PATH for pipx has been added to the (base) environment:
    

```bash
pipx ensurepath --force
```

* I allow pipx to perform actions with the --global argument:
    

```bash
sudo pipx ensurepath --global
```

* I use the Nano text editor to open the .bashrc file:
    

```bash
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
```

* I scroll to the bottom (CTRL + END) of the file, add (CTRL + SHIFT + V) the following, save (CTRL + S) the changes, and exit (CTRL + X) Nano:
    

```bash
eval "$(register-python-argcomplete3 pipx)"
```

* I close the Terminal:
    

```bash
exit
```

# What is Elia?

Elia is a terminal-based app for interacting with LLMs. It's designed to be keyboard-focused, efficient, and fun to use. It saves your conversations in a local SQLite database and lets you interact with different models. You can chat with proprietary models like ChatGPT and Claude, or with local models using ollama or LocalAI.

## Installing Elia.

* I use pipx to install Elia:
    

```bash
pipx install elia-chat
```

## Launching Elia.

* I list the local models that are available to the Ollama LLM manager:
    

```bash
ollama list
```

* I can use Ollama to download any model that may be appropriate for Elia, e.g.:
    

```bash
ollama pull llama3-gradient
```

* I can hellospecify a local LLM for Elia to use, e.g.:
    

```bash
elia -m ollama/llama3-gradient
```

* I launch the Elia Terminal from the (base) Terminal:
    

```bash
elia
```

## Wiping the Database.

* I can wipe the Elia database, if required:
    

```bash
elia reset
```

## Removing Elia.

* I can remove the Elia Terminal, if required:
    

```bash
pipx uninstall elia-chat
```
