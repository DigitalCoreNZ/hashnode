```bash
chmod +x /media/brian/Downloads/Ubuntu/WinBoat/winboat-0.8.5-x86_64.AppImage
```

* I use the Nano text editor to create a desktop entry:
    

```bash
nano ~/.local/share/applications/winboat.desktop
```

* I paste (CTRL + SHIFT + V) the following into the desktop entry, save (CTRL + S) the changes, and exit (CTRL + X) the Nano text editor:
    

```bash
[Desktop Entry]
