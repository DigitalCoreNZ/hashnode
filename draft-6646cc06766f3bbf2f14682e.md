# The Big Picture.

# Prerequisites.

* A Debian-based Linux distro (I use Ubuntu).
    

# Updating my Base System.

* From the (base) terminal, I update my (base) system:
    

```python
sudo apt clean && \
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y && \
sudo apt --fix-broken install && \
sudo apt autoclean && \
sudo apt autoremove -y
```

> NOTE: The Ollama LLM manager is already installed on my (base) system.

# What is Langflow?

Langflow is a user-friendly interface for LangChain, built using react-flow. It lets me easily create, and test, different setups by dragging and dropping components and using a chat box. Each part of the graph in Langflow works on its own. It's designed to help me quickly try out new ideas and build AI applications without needing to write much code. Langflow comes with ready-to-use components that I can mix and match to build AI apps. It fits perfectly with the tools I already use and makes it simple to develop basic, or advanced, AI applications. Langflow is all about making AI integration straightforward while expanding what I can do with AI in both tests and real-life use cases.
