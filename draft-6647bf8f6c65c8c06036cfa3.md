# Prerequisites.

* A Debian-based Linux distro (I use Ubuntu).
    

# Updating my Base System.

* From the (base) terminal, I update my (base) system:
    

```python
sudo apt clean && \
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y && \
sudo apt --fix-broken install && \
sudo apt autoclean && \
sudo apt autoremove -y
```

> NOTE: The Ollama LLM manager is already installed on my (base) system.

# What is an LMS?

A learning management system (LMS) is a software application used to manage, document, report, and deliver educational courses, training programs, and learning materials. A modern LMS is an online platform that supports online eLearning. A properly implement system improves the learning experience with automation, makes education more accessible, and provides useful insights to its' users.

## Overview.

Here is a high-level overview of the steps involved in creating an LMS framework:

### Defining the Scope and Goals of the Framework.

I need to determine what type of learning management system I want to build, what features it should have, and what kind of users it will be designed for.

### Researching Existing Frameworks.

I need to look at other learning management systems that are similar in nature to my proposed framework. I analyse their strengths and weaknesses, and identify areas where my framework can improve upon them.

### Developing a Detailed Design Document.

I need to create a comprehensive design document that outlines the architecture of the framework, including the components, interfaces, and data models. This document should also include information about the user interface, security features, and other relevant details.

### Adopting a Programming Language and Environment.

I need to choose a programming language and development environment that are suitable for building the framework. I can build mobile apps using a meta framework like React Native or a cross platform framework like Flutter, or I can build web applications using a high-level framework like Django or a full stack framework like Ruby on Rails.

### Testing the Iterations.

Once I have implemented the framework, I need to test it thoroughly to ensure that it meets my requirements. I then iterate on the design and implementation based on feedback from my testers, users, and stakeholders.

### Deploying the Framework.

Once the framework is complete, I need to deploy it to a hosting environment like Heroku or AWS. I make sure to configure any necessary security settings while optimizing the performance of the framework for an outstanding user experience.

### Maintaining, Updating, and Upgrading the Framework.

As new features and technologies emerge, I need to maintain and update the framework regularly to ensure that it remains relevant and effective. This may involve updating the codebase, adding new components or features, or integrating with other systems.
