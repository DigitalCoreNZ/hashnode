# An Introduction.

# The Big Picture.

\[pending\]

---

# Prerequisites.

* A Debian-based Linux distro (I use Ubuntu),
    
* [Miniconda](https://solodev.app/installing-miniconda) (preferably running in the (base) environment),
    
* [Ollama](https://solodev.app/installing-ollama) (preferably running in the (base) environment), and
    
* [Git](https://solodev.app/installing-git) (preferably running in the (base) environment).

# Updating my Base System.

* From the (base) terminal, I update my (base) system:
    

```python
sudo apt clean && \
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y && \
sudo apt --fix-broken install && \
sudo apt autoclean && \
sudo apt autoremove -y
```

> NOTE: The Ollama LLM manager is already installed on my (base) system.

# What is Anaconda and Miniconda?

Python projects can run in virtual environments. These isolated spaces are used to manage project dependencies. Different versions of the same package can run in different environments while avoiding version conflicts.

venv is a built-in Python 3.3+ module that runs virtual environments. Anaconda is a Python and R distribution for scientific computing that includes the `conda` package manager. Miniconda is a small, free, bootstrap version of Anaconda that also includes the `conda` package manager, Python, and other packages that are required or useful (like pip and zlib).

[https://solodev.app/installing-miniconda](https://solodev.app/installing-miniconda).

I ensure [Miniconda is installed](https://solodev.app/installing-miniconda) (`conda -V`) before continuing with this post.

## Creating a Miniconda Environment.

* I use the `conda` command to display a `list` of Miniconda `env`ironments:
    

```bash
conda env list
```

* I use `conda` to `create`, and `activate`, a new environment named (-n) (AutoGroq):
    

```bash
conda create -n AutoGroq python=3.11 -y && conda activate AutoGroq
```

> NOTE: This command creates the (AutoGroq) environment, then activates the (AutoGroq) environment.

## Creating the AutoGroq Home Directory.

> NOTE: I will now define the home directory in the environment directory.

* I create the AutoGroq home directory:
    

```bash
mkdir ~/AutoGroq
```

* I make new directories within the (AutoGroq) environment:
    

```bash
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3/envs/AutoGroq/etc/conda/activate.d
```

* I use the Nano text editor to create the `set_working_directory.sh` shell script:
    

```bash
sudo nano ~/miniconda3/envs/AutoGroq/etc/conda/activate.d/set_working_directory.sh
```

* I copy the following, paste (CTRL + SHIFT + V) it to the `set_working_directory.sh` script, save (CTRL + S) the changes, and exit (CTRL + X) Nano:
    

```bash
cd ~/AutoGroq
```

* I activate the (base) environment:
    

```bash
conda activate
```

* I activate the (AutoGroq) environment:
    

```bash
conda activate AutoGroq
```

> NOTE: I should now, by default, be in the `~/AutoGroq` home directory.

# What is AutoGroq?

AutoGroq is a tool that changes how users work with Autogen™ Studio and other AI assistants. It automatically creates teams of AI agents based on what the project needs. This means developers don't have to set up agents manually and can handle any question, problem, or project more easily and efficiently.

## Installing AutoGroq.

* I change to my Home directory:
    

```bash
cd ~
```

* I clone the GitHub repo:
    

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jgravelle/AutoGroq.git
```

* I return to the AutoGroq directory:
    

```bash
cd ~/AutoGroq
```

* I use pip to install the requirements:
    

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* I run AutoGroq:
    

```bash
streamlit run ~/AutoGroq/AutoGroq/main.py
```

* In the terminal, I stop running AutoGroq with CTRL + C.
    

## Configuring AutoGroq.

* I change to the AutoGroq sub-directory:
    

```bash
cd ~/AutoGroq/AutoGroq
```

* I copy the config\_local.py.example file as config\_local.py
    

```bash
cp config_local.py.example config_local.py
```

* I open the config\_local.py in the Nano text editor:
    

```bash
sudo nano config_local.py
```
