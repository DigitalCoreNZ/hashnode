# An Introduction.

# The Big Picture.

There are three main areas of concern:

# Prerequisites.

* A Debian-based Linux distro (I use Ubuntu).
    

# Updating my Base System.

* From the (base) terminal, I update my (base) system:
    

```python
sudo apt clean && \
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y && \
sudo apt --fix-broken install && \
sudo apt autoclean && \
sudo apt autoremove -y
```

> NOTE: The Ollama LLM manager is already installed on my (base) system.

# What is the Plan?

I have three problem domains:

1. Browser websites,
    
2. Mobile apps, and
    
3. AI tooling.
    

Each domain requires:

* Design,
    
* Development,
    
* Testing,
    
* Deployment, and
    
* Monitoring.
    

## Browser Websites: Developer Tools.
